1 	Creational Patterns
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating
objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be
created for a given use case.

2 	Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces
and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

3 	Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
